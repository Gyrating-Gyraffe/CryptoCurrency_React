//1. In Services/ChartService add typing to the coin apiData received for the chart.
//2. Continue working on ChartService logic and design.
//3. Add strong typing to ApiService promise return type.
4. Add live report validation - if no coins are selected we don't display the chart and instead display
    a warning to the user. Consider all possibilities - Clicking the nav button, using the route url.
//6. Some coins pulled from CoinGecko don't have live pricing in CryptoCompare. Decide on handling - 
    Ignoring selection input or removing the button completely for these coins.
7. Consider adding a feature to ChartService that checks which selected coins have info and which don't. 
    And shows the ones that do while hiding the ones that don't.

11. Check if canvasjs has responsive sizing.
//12. *** Infinite scroll not working in Mobile version
